Jinx - Flickr API for Java

Jinx is a Java interface to the Flickr API. The project goals are:

1) Simple and straightforward to use
2) Pure java with no other dependencies
3) Complete coverage of the Flickr API

CURRENT STATUS
==============
The API is being implemented a section at a time. The parts that are implemented should be stable enough for production use.
This library is used by SuprSetr, which is making thousands of calls to the API every day.

This list shows which API entry points have been implemented:
  * activity
  * auth
  * blogs
  * collections
  * commons
  * contacts
  * favorites
  * galleries
  * groups
  * groups.members
  * groups.pools
  * interestingness
  * machinetags (partial)
  * panda
  * people
  * photos
  * photos.comments
  * photos.geo          (NOTE: Some of the methods in photos.geo do not work correctly.
                               They also do not work in the Flickr API Explorer,
                               so there is likely little that can be done about it.)
  * photos.licenses
  * photosets



BUILDING
========
To build the project, use Maven. The jar file will end up in the "target" directory:

mvn clean package

If the tests are failing and you want to build the jar anyway, add -DskipTests:

mvn clean package -DskipTests


TODO:

Implement these API entry points:
photos.notes
photos.people
photos.transform
photos.upload
photosets.comments
places
prefs
reflection
stats
tags
test
urls


DEVELOPERS READ THIS
====================
Flickr apps need an API key to work properly. Jinx is no exception. To run
the unit tests, you need to go to Flickr and apply for an API key. Once you have
this key, you need to do the following:
  * Copy the file test/resources/flickr.properties to test/resources/secret.properties
  * Fill in the key, secret, and a valid full path where the token will be saved
  * Run the AuthApiTest
  * Authorize the application
  * Close the browser window and wait for the test to complete

You should now be able to run the rest of the tests. The secret.properties file is excluded by the .gitignore file,
so your secrets should not end up on github.

NOTE: The test token will have WRITE access to your photostream! Do not authorize the test application if
      you are concerned about possible data loss due to test errors!

When you create a unit test, your setUpClass method should look like this:

@BeforeClass
public static void setUpClass() throws Exception {
    Setup.doSetup();
}

This will ensure that Jinx is set up with your key, secret, and token, and the
unit tests can be executed.
